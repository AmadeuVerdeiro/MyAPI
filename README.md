# MY OWN API RUNNING

Hi, for you to see my knowledge about creating APIs and consuming data in JavaScript project...

# DESCRIPTION

    I've built a robust web application using JavaScript and Node.js for the backend. The application is hosted on Render, a cloud platform known for its ease of use and scalability. To manage and store data, I've integrated PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database. This ensures efficient data handling and storage for the application.

On the frontend, I've crafted a user-friendly interface using a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The frontend is responsible for presenting the data to users in an intuitive and visually appealing way. To retrieve data from the backend, I've implemented the Fetch API, allowing seamless communication between the frontend and backend components.

    For deployment, I've chosen Vercel, a platform that specializes in hosting web applications and providing fast and reliable delivery to end-users. This ensures that the application is not only well-constructed but also performs optimally, providing a smooth user experience.

In summary, my web application is a synergy of technologies and platforms, with the backend on Render, data storage in PostgreSQL, a user-friendly frontend powered by JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and seamless data retrieval using the Fetch API. Vercel handles the deployment, making the application accessible and performant for users around the world."
